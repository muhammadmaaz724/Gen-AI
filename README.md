# 🧠 Generative AI Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Generative AI Practice Repository** — a personal learning space where I explore various aspects of Generative AI and commit everything I build or experiment with.

This repo serves as a logbook of my learning journey — from basic prompts to small applications using tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT-4**, **Streamlit**, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is:

- To document my daily/weekly learnings in Generative AI
- To implement small, meaningful projects or features as I go
- To progressively build up from simple prompt engineering to multi-component GenAI apps

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [OpenAI API (GPT-4)](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) *(coming soon)*

## 🔁 Continuous Learning

I’ll continue adding:
- Prompt experiments
- Small Streamlit apps
- LangChain agents and tools
- Document Q&A apps
- Multi-modal experiments *(future plan)*
