Matches are played on an oval field with a rectangular 22-yard long pitch at the center. One team bats to score runs, while the other bowls and fields to restrict runs and dismiss batters.\n",

      "There are three major formats of the game: Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Test cricket is the oldest and most traditional format, played over five days. ODIs consist of 50 overs per side and are usually played in a single day. T20s are the shortest international format, with each team playing 20 overs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Major international competitions include the ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy, and the World Test Championship.
